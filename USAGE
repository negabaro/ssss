Description:
    Suspenders is a Rails template with thoughtbot standard
    defaults, ready to deploy to Heroku.

    For full details on the changes we've made compared to
    a vanilla Rails app, check our GitHub project:
        https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders

Example:
    suspenders ~/Code/weblog

    This generates a Rails installation in ~/Code/weblog configured
    with our preferred defaults.
